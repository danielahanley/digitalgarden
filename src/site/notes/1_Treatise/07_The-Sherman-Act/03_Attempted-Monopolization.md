# Attempted Monopolization

Conduct amounts to unlawful attempted monopolization if a firm uses its monopoly power to "destroy threatened competition."[^1]

Insightful indictors for determining whether conduct is an unlawful attempt to monopolize include:

* Whether the alleged violator has monopoly power.[^2]
* Whether their is an attempted by the alleged violator to destroy a competitor and enhance its monopoly power.[^3]
* Whether the conduct at issue also threatens the existence of a competitor.[^4]
* Whether the conduct at issue is not authorized by some other principle of law or statute.[^5]

[^2]: Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U.S. 143, 152 (1951) (“{t}he most illuminating” fact for the determination that the conduct is an unlawful attempt to monopolize is the “substantial monopoly” the Journal had – amounting it to being “an indispensable medium of advertising for many Lorain concerns.”).
[^3]: Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U.S. 143, 153 (1951) (the district court “found unequivocally” that the Journal’s conduct “amounted to an attempt by the publisher to destroy WEOL and, at the same time, to regain the publisher's pre-1948 substantial monopoly over the mass dissemination of all news and advertising.”)
[^4]: Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U.S. 143, 153 (1951) ("{R}efus{ing} to print Lorain advertising for those using WEOL for like advertising often amounted to an effective prohibition of the use of WEOL for that purpose. Numerous Lorain advertisers wished to supplement their local newspaper advertising with local radio advertising but could not afford to discontinue their newspaper advertising in order to use the radio. WEOL's greatest potential source of income was local Lorain advertising. Loss of that was a major threat to its existence.")
[^5]: Lorain Journal Co. v. United States, 342 U.S. 143, 154 n.8 (1951) (We find no principle of law which required Lorain advertisers thus to boycott an Elyria advertising medium merely because the publisher of a Lorain advertising medium had chosen to boycott some Elyria advertisers who might compete for business in the Lorain market. Nor do we find any principle of law which permitted this publisher to dictate to prospective advertisers that they might advertise either by newspaper or by radio but that they might not use both facilities.).
